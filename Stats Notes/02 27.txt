Geometric Distribution:
    Based on identical and independent binary trials.
    Count the number of trials carried out until the first success. 
    Using the 0/1 notation, we consider sequences such as: 
        0001
        01
        000000001
        1
        000001
        Etc.
        
    If random variable Y records the number of trials carried out up to an 
    including the first success, then:
        p(y)=P(Y=y)=q^(y-1) *p
            where:y for {1,2,3,...}
    and zero for other values of y. This follows as:
        Y=y<==>"y-1 failures, followed by ???"
         
    Expected and Variance:
        Formula's p116 Definition 3.5:
            E(Y)=1/p 
            V(Y)=(1-p)/p^2

    A fair coin is tossed.
