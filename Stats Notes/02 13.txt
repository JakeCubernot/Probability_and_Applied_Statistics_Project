Multiplicative Law of Probability:
	The probability of the intersection of two elements A and B is: 
	P(A intersects B) = P(A) P(A|B)
	If A and B are independent, ...

General Addition Rule: For two arbitrary events A and B
	If A and B are mutually exclusive, P(A intersects B) = 0. 

Theorem 2.7 ** P(A) = 1 - P(A')
