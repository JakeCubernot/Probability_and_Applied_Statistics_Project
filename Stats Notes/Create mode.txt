Monte carlo sim: 
	TODO: Reorganize methods, i.e. we dont need to reshuffle deck 100000 times 
	Bonus: Show monte carlo sim abstracted out completetly from the "game" class.

New TODO: Continue Pokemon tcg implementation: add an interface, name it Attackable() and give it 2 abstract methods, attackOne() and attackTwo().

The main purpose of this interface inclusion is to let you add user interface to simply attack by choosing a1 or a2 instead of searching for a name. 

Add a trainer "Professor's Research"
Rebuild deck using equal parts PR, Energy, etc.
