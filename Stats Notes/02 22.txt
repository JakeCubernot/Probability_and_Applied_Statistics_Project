Expectations for discrete random variables:
    The expectation (or expected value) of a discrete random variable Y, denoted E[Y ],
    is defined as: photo*

Variance:
    The variance of random variable Y is denoted V[Y ], and is defined by: photo
    The standard deviation of Y is: photo

The binomial distribution: 
    We can now consider specific pmfs that correspond to particular experimental settings.
    The goal is to find the probability of an event that can either succeed or fail, and run that event
    some amount of times. photo & pg 101 def 3.6, property #5 is important*

Observation: 
    We've been mainly looking at when P(Y=y). But according to the fomula's we've
    been skipping, we can just add them up if it's a <= or >= etc.
    P(Y>2) if there are 5 things would be ~> P(Y=3)+P(Y=4)+P(Y=5)

Programming Assignment: photo
    Part 1:
        Let's write another Monte Carlo Simulation. We'll use our existing Pokemon
        deck to do this. 
        A Charizard deck needs to find a rare candy to have a chance at winning. 
        What if, the rare candy wasn't in the deck, but in the prize pile.
        So write a monte carlo simulation adding 1, then 2, then 3, then 4 rare 
        candy trainer cards into your deck (you don't have to implement) 
        15 Pokemon in deck, 15 energy, rest your trainer (4 rare candy). 
        Once again, find the odds, given that a Pokemon was in the opening hand, what are the odds that your
        deck is "bricked." So what's the probability that your rare candy is in your prize pile. 
    Part 2: 
        Once your program runs and works. Solve it using math and conditional probability.
