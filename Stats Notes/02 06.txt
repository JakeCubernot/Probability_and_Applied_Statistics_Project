Example 2.4:
A wins 2/3 of time
and B is 1/3 of time
AA AB BA BB
4/9 2/9 2/9 1/9
multiplied probabilities of both games
P(C) = 8/9

the OR and AND in problems matter, mean + or *

2.33 p40: in solutions 0

Combinations: (order doesnt matter)
C(n, r) where n!/(r!(n-r)!)
do P and C on a calculator!

program P and C in stats library and starts adding all formulas there.

Combinatorial Probability Example:
five cards are selected without replacement from a stardard deck (52 cards, no jokers). What's the probability they are all Hearts?
P(A) = A / S = 0.000495...

consider p43 theorem 2.2 & p46 2.4
p46 2.11: 10

do p48-51 step: in photo, red problems are very important!
