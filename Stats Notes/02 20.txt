Random variables? 

Example: Two Coins
	two coins are tossed with the outcomes being independent. The sample space is the list of sequences of possible outcomes.
	S = {HH, HT, TH, TT}
	with all sequences equally likely.
	Define the random varible Y by:
		Y(s) = "the number of heads in sequence s"
Note:
	In the original probability specification for events in S
		There's a 25% chance of each event to happen.

Discrete random variables:
	A random variable Y is termed discrete if the possible values that Y can take is a countable set

***Probability Mass Function: 
	The probability mass function (pmf) for Y, p(.), is the mathematical function that records how probability is distributed across points in R. 
	That is.
		p(y) = P(Y=y) 
	(Y=y) - The set of all points in S assigned the value y by the random variable Y.
	P(Y=y) - The probability that Y takes on the value of y.

PMF: The pmf could be defined pointwise: for example - photos

Example: A bag contains 7 red balls and 5 black balls. 4 balls are selected, with all sequences of selections being equally likely.
Let Y be the random variable recording the number of red balls selected.
What is:
	p(y) = P(Y=y)
* This is a technique that can be applied to a problem but does not always work.
